# Claude Instructions (Project Contract)

## Goal
Build an MVP of the board game “My Toy Shop” as a web app first, with easy iOS conversion via Capacitor.

## Tech Stack
- React + Vite + TypeScript
- Capacitor (iOS)
- No backend in MVP (local state only). Persist later if needed.

## Commands
- Install: npm install
- Dev: npm run dev
- Test: npm test (if present)
- Lint: npm run lint
- Format: npm run format
- Build: npm run build
- Preview build: npm run preview

## Rules for changes
- Always keep the app runnable after changes.
- Prefer small, safe commits.
- If you add dependencies, explain why and keep them minimal.
- Do NOT invent game rules. If uncertain, ask to confirm with the provided spec in /docs.

## Repo structure
- /src: app code
- /docs: product + rules spec
- /ios: generated by Capacitor (do not hand-edit, unless native fix is required)

## Quality bar
- TypeScript strict
- No console errors
- Basic unit tests for core scoring logic (when added)
