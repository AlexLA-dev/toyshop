# My Toy Shop — Rules

## Components
- 68 cards: 64 toy cards, 4 starter cash register cards
- 45 money tokens (10 coins each)
- 16 award tokens: 4 for toy diversity, 4 for most identical toys, 8 spare
- 7 player tokens, 7 stands, 1 score tracker, rules

## Setup
- Place score tracker, money tokens, awards on table
- Each player picks a character, gets a random starter cash register card
- Shuffle toy cards face down, reveal 4 to center (market)

## Goal
Become the best toy shop owner: arrange toys so groups of the same type earn more coins; collect awards.

## Turn (3 steps)
1. **Take a card**: Pick one of 4 open toy cards, attach it to your layout (must touch at least one side, no flipping, no offset/angles)
2. **Earn coins**: If the new card's colored area touches an area of the same color — earn 1 coin per toy in the entire connected region (cash register connects but doesn't earn coins itself; minimum 1 coin for touching the register). Move token on score tracker.
3. **Reveal**: Draw a new card from the deck to replace the taken card.

## In-Game Awards
After step 2 check: collected 5 different toys of one type (plush=blue, dolls=purple, vehicles=red, sports=green)? Take a diversity award (worth 5 coins at end; no one else can take it).

## End
Game ends when all players have built a 4×4 grid of cards (cash register inside).

## End-Game Awards
Compare by type: whoever has the most identical toys of one type takes the majority award (5 coins; ties — youngest takes colored, others get spare).

## Final Scoring
Coins earned during play + 5 per award. Highest total wins.

## Toy List
- **Plush (blue)**: puppy, bunny, cat, unicorn, bear
- **Dolls (purple)**: mermaid, robot, ballerina, doctor, princess
- **Vehicles (red)**: rocket, crane, car, fire truck, train
- **Sports (green)**: bicycle, rackets, rollerblades, ball, swim ring

## Tile Layouts
Each card is a square divided into colored blocks:
- **Full**: entire tile is one color (one toy type)
- **Two halves**: tile split into 2 equal rectangles (horizontal or vertical)
- **Half + two quarters**: one half + two quarter blocks
- **Four quarters**: tile split into 4 equal squares
